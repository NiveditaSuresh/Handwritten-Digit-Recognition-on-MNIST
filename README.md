# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-on-MNIST
This project is a Handwritten-digit Recognition system to classify 60000 images from MNIST dataset. The Deep learning architecture was constructed employing two approaches; Convolutional Neural Networks and Subspace Approximation with Augmented Kernels (SAAK) transform.

This repository also contains a python file my_MLP_fn.py that has my own code for a Multi-layer perceptron neural network which takes in network paramteres like number of hidden layers, neurons in each layer, activation fn, weight initialization and regularization parameter implemented using NumPy on Python.
